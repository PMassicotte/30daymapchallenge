<p>The tz_canada shapefile (<a href="tz_canada.zip">zip</a>, <a href="tz_canada.zip.sha1">sha1</a>) captures the TZ timezones of Canada.</p>

<p>The geometries are primarily derived from the <a href="/maps/fips-10/map">fip10s</a> layer, which is in turn primarily based on the VMAP0 polbnda layer. The sources of the intra-provinces boundaries are described below.</p>

<p>All the TZ timezones of Canada listed in TZ’s zone.tab are represented. In addition, we elected to retain America/Coral_Harbour as a geographical timezone.</p>
<h3>Snapshot of the shapefile</h3>
<p>This is a snaphsot of the shapefile (many of the smaller zones are not visible at this scale):</p>

<h4>CA03 Manitoba</h4>
<ul>
  <li>America/Winnipeg for the whole province</li>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>America/St_Johns, America/Goose_Bay: the boundary between the two is approximately that shown at <a href="http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/Magazine/SO98/alacarte.asp">http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/Magazine/SO98/alacarte.asp</a>. Data provided by Chris Walton. Chris writes: 
    The boundary between Atlantic Time and Newfoundland Time is somewhat arbitrary and to the best of my knowledge is not published in any detail on any government issued maps.  This is rugged terrain with very few people.  I placed Cartwright and the Cartwright airport are on Atlantic Time and Paradise River on Newfoundland time which I believe to be correct.    </p>

  </ul>
<h4>CA07 Nova Scotia</h4>
<ul>
  <li>America/Halifax, America/Glace_Bay: the boundary between the two is ?</li>
  </ul>

</ul>
<h4>CA11 Saskatchewan</h4>
<p>The Saskatchewan <a href="http://www.qp.gov.sk.ca/documents/English/Statutes/Statutes/T14.pdf">Time Act</a> provides for various areas, in particular <a href="http://www.sasked.gov.sk.ca/branches/comm/minister/docs/SD_Pb_SR_Appendix A_2004.06.pdf">school divisions</a> (before their reorganization) to choose their time.</p>
<ul>
  <li>America/Swift_Current is around the town of Swift Current. We (arbitrarily) use the Swift Current city limits. [Should that be the Swift Current Time Option Area: the Swift Current Rural School Division No. 75 of 
    Saskatchewan, the Swift Current School Division No. 94
    and the Swift Current Roman Catholic Separate School
  Division No. 11 of Saskatchewan?] Data digitized from CanMatrix map 075J05 <em>Swift Current</em>, 3rd edition. </li>
  <li>America/Edmonton for the Battle River Time Option Area, defined by the Battle River School Division No. 60. Data provided by Chris Walton.</li>

<h4>CA14 Nunavut</h4>
<ul>
  <li>America/Resolute is the Cornwallis island</li>
  <li>America/Coral_Harbour is at least the Southampton island; we also include somewhat arbitrarily White and Coats islands and smaller islands in the area. Note that America/Coral_Harbour is linked by tz to America/Atikokan and does not appear in zone.tab, but it probably should</li>
  <li>America/Pangnirtung is the area east of 68W</li>
  <li>America/Iqaluit is the area between 85W and 68W, excluding the area attributed to America/Coral_Harbour</li>
  <li>America/Cambdridge_Bay and America/Rankin_Inlet form the rest of the territory. The boundary is ? Data provided by Chris Walton.</li>

<h3>Construction of the shapefile</h3>

<p>The ingredients (<a href="tz_canada_ingredients.zip">zip</a>, <a href="tz_canada_ingredients.zip.sha1">sha1</a>) contain a set of source shapefiles and a script to build the final map from them.</p>

<p>We have a separate shapefile for each province. In each shapefile, we capture the timezone boundaries internal to the province. The idea is that those shapefiles can be combined with various base shapefiles providing the provincial boundaries. (The particular problem we want to solve is that Canada has many islands, and we prefer to not have to worry about those and the provinces they are in when dealing with timezones).</p>
